# south-river-resorts
A project done for school.

This is a J2EE Web Application that allows users to log in, book or cancel their reservations.

The project was developed in a team. Author names are available on top of each file. I was responsible for "ca.okbutwhy" and "ca.okbutwhy.data" packages, and "senhotelmenu.jspx", "reserveroom.jspx" pages.
